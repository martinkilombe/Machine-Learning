    "Random Forest is a popular and powerful ensemble learning technique used in machine learning for both classification and regression tasks. It is based on the concept of decision trees and combines multiple trees to make more accurate predictions. In this tutorial, I'll teach you about Random Forest in machine learning:\n",
    "\n",
    "What is Random Forest?\n",
    "Random Forest is an ensemble method that builds multiple decision trees during training and combines their outputs for better predictive performance. It gets its name from the randomness introduced in the model-building process. Random Forest is highly versatile and can handle various types of data, including both categorical and numerical features.\n",
    "\n",
    "How Does Random Forest Work?\n",
    "Here's a step-by-step explanation of how Random Forest works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Bootstrapping (Random Sampling): The algorithm starts by creating multiple subsets of the training data through random sampling with replacement. Each subset is called a \"bootstrap sample.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Feature Selection: At each node of the decision tree, instead of considering all features for splitting, Random Forest randomly selects a subset of features to split on. This introduces diversity among the individual trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Decision Tree Building: For each bootstrap sample and for each node in the tree, a decision tree is constructed. These trees are often referred to as \"base learners\" or \"weak learners.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Voting or Averaging: For classification tasks, the predictions of each tree are combined through a majority vote (mode), while for regression tasks, the predictions are averaged.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Reduced Variance: Because the trees are constructed using bootstrapped samples and feature subsets, each tree is slightly different. This diversity helps reduce overfitting and increases the model's generalization ability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages of Random Forest:\n",
    "Excellent predictive performance for a wide range of tasks.\n",
    "Robust to overfitting due to ensemble averaging.\n",
    "Handles both numerical and categorical data.\n",
    "Provides feature importances to understand the importance of each feature.\n",
    "Can handle missing data."
