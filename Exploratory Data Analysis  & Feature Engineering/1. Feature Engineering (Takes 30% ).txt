1. Feature Engineering (Takes 30% of Project Time)
   a) EDA
     i)   Analyze how many numerical features are present using histogram, pdf with seaborn, matplotlib.
     ii)  Analyze how many categorical features are present. Is multiple categories present for each feature?
     iii) Missing Values (Visualize all these graphs)
     iv)  Outliers - Boxplot
     v)   Cleaning
     
   b) Handling the Missing Values
     i)   Mean/Median/Mode
     
   c) Handling Imbalanced dataset 
   d) Treating the Outliers
   e) Scaling down the data - Standardization, Normalization
   f) Converting the categorical features into numerical features

2. Feature Selection
   a) Correlation
   b) KNeighbors
   c) ChiSquare
   d) Genetic Algorithm
   e) Feature Importance - Extra Tree Classifiers
   
3. Model Creation
4. Hyperparameter Tuning
5. Model Deployment
6. Incremental Learning
